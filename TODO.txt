1. Add feature to upload documents or create directly.
2. Import from Google docs and sheets


Knowledge base method idea:

Documents will be written in a specific folder in Google Drive.
The server will create a file system-like structure in the navigation pane.
When a document is clicked in the nav pane, it will be rendered in the main page.
Creating a new KB will ultimately just create a new doc in the KB folder.
Editing a document will edit in the KB folder. 
No interaction should be required with the actual Google docs folder but it will act as a database of sorts. 

Possible features:
- New KB Approval? Notification via email. All KBs could potential go through the IT director.
- Editing functions within the site? Bold, Italics, etc.
-
